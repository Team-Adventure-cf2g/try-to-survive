` A survival experience

Users will be given an option of what items they would take with them if they were to be lost or stranded in the wilderness
Users will be dropped into a scenario where they will have to make decisions that will keep them alive with the goal to make it back home (or something like that)

The pain point for this project would be a fun way to kill some time when otherwise unoccupied, while also giving the user important knowledge on how they would fare being dropped into similar scenarios.

Minimum Viable Product

The minimal viable product should query the user to select an item. Created an instance of some kind of Survivor object which is given  properties that sustain their life which will be decremented or incremented depending on decisions made throughout the experience. A full decrement will result in the Survivor object being deconstructed and the user having to start over. Otherwise their progress should be saved to localStorage. There will be an emphasis on presentation as the project will be about immersing the user into the experience
