      <p>I worked for years as a Wilderness Guide in the summer, Environmental Educator 
        in the fall and spring, and Snowboard Instructor in the winter. Life was good. In 
        search of a more sustainable career path, I made my way back to the Pacific Northwest 
        to work for Tesla as a sales rep in their Seattle showroom. The office views aren’t nearly 
        as good, but I’m able to continue working towards a cleaner and greener tomorrow thanks 
        to Tesla’s unique mission. As more and more people buy Tesla’s products directly through 
        the website, I long to gain the skills needed to better embrace this ‘online-only’ 
        purchase culture. I hope to be able to educate many more people about the benefits of 
        electric transportation and solar energy through web platforms, rather than relying on foot 
        traffic. Cue CodeFellows!</p>
