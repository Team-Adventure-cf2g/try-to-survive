            I worked for years as a Wilderness Guide in the summer,
            Environmental Educator in the fall and spring, and Snowboard
            Instructor in the winter. Life was good. In search of a more
            sustainable career path, I made my way back to the Pacific Northwest
            to work for Tesla as a sales rep in their Seattle showroom. The
            office views aren’t nearly as good, but I’m able to continue working
            towards a cleaner and greener tomorrow thanks to Tesla’s unique
            mission. As more and more people buy Tesla’s products directly
            through the website, I long to gain the skills needed to better
            embrace this ‘online-only’ purchase culture. I hope to be able to
            educate many more people about the benefits of electric
            transportation and solar energy through web platforms, rather than
            relying on foot traffic. Cue CodeFellows!

            My name Cody, I'm a software devoloper based out of seattle. I found
            a love for coding after spending 8 years in the army working in the
            IT field, it started as a hobby modding video games which later grew
            into a passion for creating, I hope to get the skills needed to
            bring my ideas to life.
