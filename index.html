      <h1>Welcome to Try To Survive</h1>
      <img src="./img/landing.jpg" alt="restfull campfire">
      <p>On your six o'clock fight to Tahiti a strange man sat next to you. From the very beggining something about this man felt wrong.
         about 30 minutes into the flight he hands you some Kool-Aid and tells you that if you vote for him for another four year everything will be great. You politely tell him "No thanks". and he replies with " Ok , then im going to kidnap you." He pulls  out a knife and the people on the plane begin to panic. The panic finds its way into the the pilots mind. The pilot has a mental breakdown and the place begins to nose dive. Somehow you survive the crash but are isolated from the other survivors and find yourself in the middle of a forest.
